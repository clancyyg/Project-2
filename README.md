# RaceTo21_Part5 Summary
This is my personal part5 and its code, in the part 5, I abandoned the MAUI and turned into the WPF, which I am more acquainted with.
In the following sentences, I will summarize what features I had realized in part 5

## Features that I realized
- A player can draw up to 3 cards each turn and get all cards at once, they can't get to decide after each card.( level 1)
- Only the winning player earns points equal to their score that round(level 1)
- Players who went “bust” lose points equal to their hand total minus 21.(level 2)
- Game ends when one player reaches an agreed-upon score(level 2)

I also changed some GUI design so that I can realize all functions that needed in RaceTo21_part5
