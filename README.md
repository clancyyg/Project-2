# RaceTo21_Part5 Summary
This section represents my journey through Part 5, where I transitioned from MAUI to WPF, a framework I'm more familiar with. Below, I detail the features implemented in this part of the project.

## Implemented Features
- A player can draw up to 3 cards each turn and get all cards at once, they can't get to decide after each card.( level 1)
- Only the winning player earns points equal to their score that round(level 1)
- Players who went “bust” lose points equal to their hand total minus 21.(level 2)
- Game ends when one player reaches an agreed-upon score(level 2)

Additionally, I've modified the GUI design to accommodate all required functionalities for RaceTo21_Part5.
